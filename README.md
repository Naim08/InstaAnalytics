##InstaAnalytics
Uses linear regression to help you forecast how many likes your next picture will get. There are alot of things that can be improved. But accuracy was around ~70%. Trained the classifier on about 10K+ images. Probably could have done a better job fitting the model. 

##Instagram
Did not use Instagram's annoying api. It sucks, literally. With requests, we creativity(hacky) got everything we wanted and more =D
